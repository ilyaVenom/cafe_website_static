<!-- Looked over w3schools helped with x
- went to w3shools to make the table
and center it well, and got the understanding for the bullet points too.
- as well as how to write the word multilingual in different colors too.
- and the emphasizing of bold, and like italics.
Oh and I had to go to stackoverflow to read about how to fix my errors, where
i forget a few ; even tho the code still looked ok on the screen and that 
I couldn't have an unordered list inside of an order list, which I did not understand.-->
